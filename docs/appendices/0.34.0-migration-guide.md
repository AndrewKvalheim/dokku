# 0.34.0 Migration Guide

## Removals

- The `disable-chown` property of the `scheduler-docker-local` plugin has been removed. Mounted paths will no longer have file permissions changed during the pre-deploy phase. Files baked into the container image for herokuish builds will always be owned by the correct user.

## Changes

- The k3s scheduler now defaults to nginx as it's default proxy implementation. The traefik proxy implementation is still available, though users will need to set the global `ingress-class` k3s property to `traefik` via the following command:

    ```shell
    dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global ingress-class traefik
    ```
